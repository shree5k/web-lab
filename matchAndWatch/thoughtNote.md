most of the time when picking a movie with friends to watch,
it starts with, “i’m up for anything,”
and ends with 40 minutes of trailer hopping, 
2 passionate debates, and somehow… no movie watched.
sure, we all have watchlists, but they’re usually just yours.
so what if we could pair our watchlists with a friend, 
mash them up, and swipe our way to a movie match?

introducing Match & Watch
a scrappy lil’ mvp where:
you swipe
they swipe
and when you both swipe right on the same title… it’s a match.
heres the link for you to play
