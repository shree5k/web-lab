# Thought Note

as a movie buff, I often find myself going toward content based on the studio behind it. Studios like HBO, Marvel, or A24 (tho JHS doesn't have that) those have a distinct identity.
after watching Succession, some would naturally want to explore more of HBO shows that carry that same tone, quality (no limits kind of thing)

we already have the Studio Tray doing a great job of surfacing this, but I wanted to explore what it might feel like if each studio tray felt more alive.

what if, instead of just a static card, there was a subtle, delightful moment on hover? a mini welcome mat of sorts that hints at the studio’s personality before you even click.

so, tried adding some iconic characters, a studio-inspired color tint, and a short ambient motion, just enough to nod to the studio’s tone, with a touch of 3D-like depth. Just enough to spark curiosity and invite users deeper into the studio’s universe.

just a little experiment as a movie buff.
